/*The variable add is assigned the return value of a self invoking function.
The self-invoking function only runs once. It sets the counter to zero (0), and returns a function expression.
This way add becomes a function. The "wonderful" part is that it can access the counter in the parent scope.
This is called a JavaScript closure. It makes it possible for a function to have "private" variables.
The counter is protected by the scope of the anonymous function, and can only be changed using the add function.*/
